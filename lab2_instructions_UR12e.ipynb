    "# EECE 5552 Lab 2: Multi-Modal Control of the UR12e: Simulation, Pendant, and Python\n",
    "\n",
    " This lab focuses on controlling and simulating UR12e robotic movements. We will practice basic control of the UR12e, use PolyScope on URSim to simulate these movements, and then implement them on the real robot arm. We will also cover advanced path planning using ROS2 Jazzy and MoveIt2 to explore complex trajectory planning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### After completing this lab, a well-prepared student should be able to:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Safely operate a UR12e manipulator\n",
    "\t- Power on, initialize, and shut down the robot\n",
    "\t- Respond correctly to emergency stops and protective stops\n",
    "2. Program basic motions in PolyScope\n",
    "\t- Create joint-space and Cartesian-space motions\n",
    "\t- Define waypoints and adjust speed and acceleration\n",
    "\t- Execute programs in both URSim and on the physical robot\n",
    "3. Transfer programs from simulation to hardware\n",
    "\t- Validate trajectories in URSim\n",
    "\t- Deploy programs to the real UR12e while accounting for joint limits, payload, and singularities\n",
    "4. Set up a ROS2 Jazzy control pipeline\n",
    "\t- Launch required ROS2 nodes\n",
    "\t- Connect to the UR12e or simulator\n",
    "\t- Verify state feedback and command execution\n",
    "6. Use MoveIt for motion planning\n",
    "\t- Configure the planning scene\n",
    "\t- Define start and goal poses\n",
    "\t- Generate collision-aware trajectories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Key terms you will encounter in this lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [UR12e](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur12e/): a medium duty industrial collaborative robot that combines both long reach and high payload. It's our robot arm used for automation tasks, capable of precise movements and programmable control.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [URSim](https://www.universal-robots.com/download/software-ur-series/simulator-non-linux/offline-simulator-ur-series-e-series-ur-sim-for-non-linux-5222/): Simulation software that mimics the UR12e’s real-world behavior, allowing for safe development and testing without using the physical robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [URScript](./docs/script_directory_Poly5_22.pdf): A scripting language used to control the UR5, either through manual commands or automation within the PolyScope interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [PolyScope](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/polyscope-5/): The UR12e’s user-friendly graphical interface for programming, which automatically generates URScript code in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ROS2 Jazzy](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/index.html): An open-source middleware that enables advanced control and integration of the UR12e with external components, allowing real-time performance and complex tasks like path planning using algorithms such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [RViz2](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Tutorials/Intermediate/RViz/RViz-User-Guide/RViz-User-Guide.html): a 3D visualizer for the ROS2 framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [MoveIt2](https://github.com/moveit/moveit2): A powerful software framework for motion planning, manipulation, and control of robots. It integrates with ROS to provide tools for collision detection, kinematics, and trajectory planning, helping to automate complex movements for robotic arms like the UR12e.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration statement: \n",
    "You should complete this assignment without collaboration with other students in the course or elsewhere. Please ask for help from the TAs or course instructors if you are getting stuck!"
