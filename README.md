Lab 2: Multi-Modal Control of the UR12e: Simulation, Pendant, and Python

This lab focuses on controlling and simulating UR12e robotic movements. We will practice basic control of the UR12e, use PolyScope on URSim to simulate these movements, and then implement them on the real robot arm. We will also cover advanced path planning using ROS2 Jazzy and MoveIt2 to explore complex trajectory planning techniques.
